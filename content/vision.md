While Nails and Hammers is ostensibly just a photo project, there is a larger vision that drives the project.

The goal for each city shot for Nails and Hammers is to produce a book with photos as well as short essays by a selection of practitioners from that city.

Costs for producing the book itself (printing, shipping, etc.) will be calculated ahead of production and all of the profits from the sale of the book will be donated, in full, to a nonprofit community organization.

That means that while Nails and Hammers is primarily a celebration of the grappling communities it touches, it is also an opportunity for each grappling community to come together to give back their city.  

I will also be making both Giclee and darkroom prints, which I will sell through this website, with a portion of the proceeds going to the same community organization.
