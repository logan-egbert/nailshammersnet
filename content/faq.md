### Are you only shooting black belts/teachers?

No! I am open to shooting **anyone** who wants to take part in Nails and Hammers. Right now, I'm only shooting in the Portland Metro area.

<br>

### How long does a shoot usually take?

It takes me about 20 minutes to get set up, if I need to use lighting. From there, most shoots have taken somewhere between 30-40 minutes.

<br>

### Does it cost me anything to take part?

No! The only thing it costs you is your time and maybe a little patience.

<br>

### Do we have to shoot at the gym?

Nope! I have a studio space that I love to shoot in. If you are dead set on shooting in your gym, I can gladly accomodate that as well!

<br>

### I want to take part, how do I set up a shoot with you?

That's easy! Head on over to the [contact](/contact) page and send me a message.
